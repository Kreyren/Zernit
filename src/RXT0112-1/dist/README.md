# Downstream distribution

To ensure the quality provided on downstream for various distributions this repository prohibits distribution maintainers from making their own 3rd party logic for a package managers thus this directory has been created to monitor the downstream while providing an upstream support.
Distribution maintainers that do not satisfy the required standard are not allowed to keep source code for Zernit in their repositories.

FIXME-LEGAL(Krey): Update Legal
FIXME-QA(Krey): Provide a CI that tests the downstream on relevant distributions
FIXME-QA(Krey): Provide a CD that distributes the downstream instructions the way that the maintainer prefers (expected to be automated once the change has been made, approved and passed QA)
